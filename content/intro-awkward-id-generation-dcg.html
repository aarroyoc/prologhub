<p>I work in an industry that likes to use an ID/label/hyperlink notation by combining a letter denoting a parent class with a number: &quot;H-1&quot;. The application I&#x27;m working on, given a parent class, needs to return the next ID. This shouldn&#x27;t be too hard if they were sequential, but ID&#x27;s can be deleted and so the next available ID needs to be returned. In this post, we explore how a DCG can be used to solve this problem.</p>

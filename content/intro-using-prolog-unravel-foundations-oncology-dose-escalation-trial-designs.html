<p>A longstanding collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/triska">@triska</a>,  applying Prolog to the specification and analysis of oncology  dose-escalation trial designs, has yielded some interesting progress  that I&#x27;d like to share. It seems to me that the current thrust of this  work employs Prolog — and indeed some new techniques like if_/3 (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01590">Neumerkel &amp; Kral 2017</a>)  — in a manner that is somehow essential to our successful attack on  certain problems in this field. As such, I think our collaboration  reflects in some interesting ways on Prolog itself. I&#x27;ll try to get  across the main gist of the application without belaboring the details.  The work I&#x27;ll describe here is contained in <a href="https://github.com/dcnorris/precautionary/blob/ff4d9f8ae8f82cfd55ea0cefcfb0e51792d59aa9/exec/prolog/dsl.pl">this self-contained file</a> from the <a href="https://dcnorris.github.io/precautionary/index.html">precautionary</a> package.

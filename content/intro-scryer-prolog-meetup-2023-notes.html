<p>The 9th and 10th of November was the Scryer Prolog Meetup 2023 in DÃ¼sseldorf. As a <a href="https://www.scryer.pl/">Scryer Prolog</a>  user and contributor, I was very excited to go to this meeting. Now,  I&#x27;m back at home and I can write here a report of what happened in this  event with the notes I&#x27;ve taken.</p>

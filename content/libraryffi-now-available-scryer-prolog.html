<p>I want to announce that library(ffi) is  now available on the master branch of Scryer Prolog. The purpose of  this library is be able to call native code via a C ABI. Note that FFI  is just one way to communicate with the outside world in Scryer Prolog:  sockets, files, pipes or the HTTP libraries are also good options  depending on the task and they&#x27;re safer. This library is based on <a href="https://sourceware.org/libffi/">libffi</a></p><br><a href="https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/discussions/1752">Visit website</a>

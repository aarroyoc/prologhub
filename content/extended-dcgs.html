<p>What are DCGs and what are &quot;extended&quot; DCGs?</p><p>One of my favourite features of Prolog are DCGs, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_clause_grammar">Definite Clause Grammars</a>. </p><p>Markus Triska has <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/dcg">a nice tutorial</a> on them, but the quick pitch is they’re basically built-in syntax for writing parsers. Forget regular expressions – in Prolog it’s just as easy to write a full-on grammar! </p><br><a href="https://occasionallycogent.com/prolog_edcgs/index.html">Visit website</a>
